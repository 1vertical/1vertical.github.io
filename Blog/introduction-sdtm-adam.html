			<h2>Introduction of SDTM and ADAM</h2>
			
			<h3>What we will cover</h3>
			<p>I present the "review questions" before the actual content to activate your brain to know what to look for. After reading the content, go back to these questions and try to recall the answer. We will be answering the following questions in this section:
				<ul>
					<li>What is CDISC?</li>
					<li>What is SEND?</li>
					<li>What is PRM?</li>
					<li>What is CDASH</li>
					<li>What is SDTM?</li>
					<li>What is ADaM?</li>
					<li>What are Data Exchange Standards?</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Before we get into the meat of things, we need to introduce a few things in the clinical research industry.</p>

			<h3>What is CDISC?</h3>
			<p>CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) is a company responsible for developing standards for clinical trials, their aim is to bring clarity to clinical research. It is developed by a group of experts in the healthcare industry. CDISC ensures standardised data that are used to collecting, organising and analysing data to create a positive impact in global health. CDISC have a collection of standards to automate the informational flow, starting with planning (PRM standard), collecting (CDASH standard), organising (SDTM standard) and ending with analysing (ADaM standard). For non-clinical standards, for organising data, the SEND standard is used.</p>

			<h3>What is SEND?</h3>
			<p>SEND is used for non-clinical data in the organisasion phase. This involves organising data such as tabulation for animal studies.</p>
			
			<h3>What is PRM?</h3>
			<p>In clinical data, PRM is a standard used for planning and designing a research protocol. It helps with creating CRFs and configuring EHRs to assist with research and sharing.</p>

			<h3>What is CDASH?</h3>
			<p>In clinical data, CDASH is a standard used for collecting data in a standardised method. It assists with the mapping of data to be used in SDTM.</p>

			<h3>What is SDTM?</h3>
			<p>SDTM is used to present data in an organised way (tabulation, formatting, etc.). SDTM also supports data aggregation (a process to retrieve data and present a summarized version) and data warehousing (informational system that facilitates reporting and analysis of data). After this step, analysis of the data can proceed. Components include: SDTMIG-MD (an implementation guide for Medical Devices), SDTMIG (an implementation guide for tabulation), SDTMIG-AP (an implementation guide for Associated Persons), SDTMIG-PGx (Pharmacogenomics and/or Pharmacogenetics), CT (Controlled Terminology), TA (Therapeutic Area) and QRS (Stands for Questionnaires, Ratings and Scales).</p>

			<h3>What is ADaM?</h3>
			<p>The last step for when the data is ready for analysis. ADaM datasets are used to ensure efficient result generation in turn maximizes produceability and traceability. ADaM is also one of the required standards for submitting data to the FDA (in US) and PMDA (in Japan).</p>

			<h3>What are Data Exchange Standards?</h3>
			<p>Makes it easier to share metadata and data across different systems. Components include: ODM-XML (Operational Data Model), Define-XML (Dataset Metadata), Dataset-XML (Dataset Data) and RDF (Resource Description Framework)</p>
